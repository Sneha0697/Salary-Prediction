# Salary-Prediction
A letter to the stakeholder, the player:

***Executive Summary***
  
  Based on our research, we've established that playing for a certain team has no bearing on the pay you'll receive. Instead, you should focus on the base income you will receive from the new team you have joined. You should also concentrate on scoring high runs in matches since this will have a beneficial impact on your pay. Also keep in mind that your performance in other categories, such as ODIs and Test Matches, has very little impact on your pay.

***Introduction***
  
  We examine and interpret data from the first four seasons of the Indian Premier League, a cricket league that takes place mostly in India from the final week of March or the first week of April and runs through the last week of May. International players from various countries sign contracts with various teams and are paid accordingly. The game is played in a Twenty-20 format.
  We grouped the data depending on the ranking of IPL teams right after the 2011 tournament to make this study more valuable in the future. This would benefit owners, players, and concerned authorities in gaining a better understanding of the upcoming seasons.
  The information was also categorized based on the player's country of origin, and then further subdivided into the International Twenty-20 ranking of those countries. This would allow us to see if the player's profile of belonging to the better-ranked countries had any bearing on the selection or salary criterion.
***Findings***
  
  The most crucial facts from the perspective of a player are his base salary, the number of runs he scores, and his high score. Although age has a consistent impact on income, it should not be the player's top priority if he meets the aforementioned requirements.
  It is critical for a player to do well in their batting role and score as many runs as possible because this has a significant effect on their income and can help them earn more than $1M.
  The player should not be concerned with the team he belongs to. If they are dissatisfied with their present team, they can contemplate transferring teams and signing a contract with a new team. There are no solid findings in the analysis to establish the link between a player's allegiance to a team and their future wage increase.
  When a player signs a new contract with a new team or an old team, it is critical that they prioritize their base wage. As it has been shown to have a substantial association with their odds of getting a raise.
  We can also see from the report that bowlers have a relatively minor impact on the way to a wage of more than $1M. To better understand this, the data was separated into batting-related explanatory variables and bowling-related explanatory variables. Only 4.77 percent of the salary projections are affected by bowling variables. Although this variable, when combined with the captain's experience, increases the percentage to 19.16 percent, it does not control a player's salary on its own. 
  The group with explanatory factors related to batting and runs scored, on the other hand, has a 16 percent effect on the entire data. The proportion rises to 29.38 percent when the data is further manipulated by adding captaincy experience and removing characteristics that have no bearing on the IPL. This effect percentage is based on highly focused data from the total runs and batting data set.
***Model***
  
  We used logistic regressions to investigate the data's accuracy. The precision of the projected data was found to be roughly 12%, while the accuracy was determined to be approximately 84 percent. Implying that this approach is inefficient, demonstrating that the provided data set requires a large number of other variables to accurately predict if a certain player has a probability of earning more than $1M. 
  Other regressions showed that squaring a variable, replacing it with exponential or logarithmic values in the case of variables that had a substantial impact on the overall effect, or replacing negative values with their square roots had no further meaningful effect on the data.
***Limitations***
  
  Why the playing role is one of the biggest limits from a player's standpoint. Its data is skewed toward batsman advancement, neglecting the contributions of players who perform other roles such as bowling and wicketkeeping. The aspiring cricketers who want to make more money, are forced to choose batting as their mainstream. 
  This information is limited to a large extent because the players' salary criteria are not provided. For example, an NBA player receives a specific percentage, approx. 44%, of the total revenue earned during the tournament. The data does not speak of the income they make per season because the IPL also has specific such standards. As a player, deciding whether to commit time and effort in that season when allowed to invest the same elsewhere would be challenging.
  When compared to articles in 'The Times of India' or 'Deccan Chronicles,' one of the most crucial elements used to determine how much the IPL players are paid is their fan base. As a result, the number of people watching the sport increases. This is another part of the data that is missing. This is a crucial component that may assist the player in realizing the fundamental goal of the IPL: to have fun, relax, and break down barriers. There are some factors that data cannot fully explain, but which should be followed for the good of the community.
***Conclusion***
  
  In general, you have complete freedom to choose the team you want to represent based on the data without having to consider payment. You should also place a premium on negotiating your base salary, as this will have an impact on your chances of earning more than one million dollars over time. To enhance your wage as a footballer, you must be physically fit and perform at a high level. Although the statistics show that high run scorers have a significant impact on pay, make sure you choose a field that you are passionate about. Become a bowler, a batsman, a wicketkeeper, or an all-rounder. Above all, be human and uphold the sportsmanship spirit.
